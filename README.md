"# RNN-issue-" 
When I build RNN model , for regression problem and I tried to use more than 1 indicators in the model , I got that the loss function is nan while I tried to train the model , I have this issue for 2 of my models that I tried to build and I would like to know whats acctualy the problem is..

I tried to look on the Internet for a solution and try couple of things - regularization and normalization, chekc out the shape of the data and staff... and I cant figure it out :(

Im sharing the code if this can help in some way...

Thanks!
